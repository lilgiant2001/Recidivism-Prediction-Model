# Recidivism-Prediction-Model
Statistical model analyzing accuracy of risk assessment algorithm's prediction of recidivism

Constructed a model predicting criminal recidivism to analyze the accuracy of the risk assessment algorithm - which is used in many machine-learning based models to predict recidivism - and demonstrate whether it is biased and needs improvement.
